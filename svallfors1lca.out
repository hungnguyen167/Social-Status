INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

  TITLE:

  Model list (those ending in "c" use the original variables,
  without "c" are Svallfors collapsed categories).

  Those ending in "lca" are latent class analyses looking to recover
  2 classes of respondents, like the extreme U-shaped distribution
  of Svallfors' coding scheme.

  svallfors1 = Multigroup model everything constrained except latent means

  svallfors2 = This model includes fixed factor loadings by group
  and intercepts for jobs allowed to vary other two fixed,
  , but means allowed to vary by group;

  svallfors3 = everything free by group, except factor loadings
  DATA: FILE = svallfors.dat;

*** WARNING in MODEL command
  All variables are uncorrelated with all other variables within class.
  Check that this is what is intended.
