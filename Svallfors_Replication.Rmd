This is a replication of Svallfors (1997) 

```{r}
library(pacman)
pacman::p_load("tidyverse","knitr","haven")
a <- "S:/Für meine Gruppen/Public Opinion and Social Policy/Hung's/OpPol/Data/ISSP/Social Inequality/"

```

This is where we import our data

```{r}
socIn92 <- read_dta(paste(a,"ZA2310.dta",sep=""))

```

```{r}
socIn92recode<-socIn92 %>%
  mutate(
    r1=recode(v57,´1`=2)
  )
