TITLE: 

Model list (those ending in "c" use the original variables,
without "c" are Svallfors collapsed categories).

svallfors1 = Multigroup model everything constrained except latent means

svallfors2 = This model includes fixed factor loadings by group
and intercepts for jobs allowed to vary others fixed,
, but means allowed to vary by group;

svallfors3 = everything free by group, except factor loadings
