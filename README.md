## Note to Users

Code is organized into numbered markdown files. The code and results can be viewed using a browser via the knitted HTML files.

The following files are too large to store in GitHub and must be downloaded by the user:

WVS_TimeSeries_1981_2020_ascii_v2_0.csv <br>
WVS_Trend_v2_0.dta <br>
ZA7503_v2-0-0.dta <br>

The workflow contains extra steps not reported in the paper because this repository is based on a project with multiple studies using the same data. We leave in the coding in case it is helpful to the user. For example, there is extensive coding of class and status in file 01, and there is a replication of previous research on redistributive attitudes in file 07.

Every knitted file ends with package References and a Colophon (a list of all packages and dependencies and their versions)
