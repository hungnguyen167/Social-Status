This file complements Fig 2 (cross country-wave correlation comparison), by testing the model fit indices for a constrained model where the correlation is fixed across all country waves (M1), and a free model where it varies (M2).

```{r setup}
pacman::p_load("lavaan",
               "tidyverse")

df_na <- readRDS(here::here("data", "df_na.RDS"))

```

## M1 - Fixed
```{r m1}
M1 <- '
      redist =~ gov_redist + a*incdiff_large'

M1_fit <- cfa(M1,
              data = df_na,
              group = "iso3c_wave")
```
## M2 - Varying by country-wave
```{r m2}
M2 <- '
      redist =~ gov_redist + incdiff_large'

M2_fit <- cfa(M2,
              data = df_na,
              group = "iso3c_wave")
```

## Fit Comparison
```{r fit}

M1_fit_out <- summary(M1_fit)
```
